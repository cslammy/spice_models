Spice simulation models. Why? Some of my Kicad Symbols have spice model files, get them here, save them on your PC's hard drive, then modify the symbol to point at the location of its model.
You may have to modify pin assignments as well. Details in the how-to post here: https://audiodiwhy.blogspot.com/2025/02/kicad-ngspice-and-minimoog-eg.html
